Causal effect of previous KO/TKO losses of a UFC fighter

# UFC Fighter Performance Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my research project on the causal impact of previous KO/TKO losses on subsequent UFC fighter performance. The project involves scraping data from the UFC website, applying advanced statistical methodologies, and deriving insights into the dynamics of fighter performance in the octagon.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** Utilized web scraping techniques to gather rich data from the UFC website.
- **Causal Inference:** Employed advanced statistical methods, including propensity score matching, to analyze the impact of prior KO/TKO losses on fighter performance.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and refined methodologies based on mid-review insights.
- **Communication:** Presented findings in a formal mid-review report, demonstrating effective communication of complex statistical concepts.
